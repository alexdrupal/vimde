TODO:

* add tags file generation for project. NOTE: added gutentags and few settings for it. Need to fix tag generation 
  for whole project. Now works for individual file only . enable trace for gutentags - the root cause is that phpctags does not support 
    reading settings from file. Gutentags try to supply options as --options. Also phpctags fails to generate tag file if one of the files in project has PHP error
* add best php autocomplete:
